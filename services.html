                        <h1> Audio Production </h1>
                        <p>I've been producing audio for the last 17 years. Professionally via major market radio since 2004, and as a hobby since 2002. Currently I produce by using a combination of FL Studio / Ableton Live / and ProTools. I have sound effect libraries available and have produced many 15 / 30 / and 60 second spots for television and radio.</p>

                        <h2> Web Development</h2>
                        <p>While I am new to web development, I am eager to take on new challenges, learn new languages, and find new techniques to improve my skillset.  I started programming in 2018 through college courses at Sullivan University and instantly wanted to learn more. This site was built for a class project to showcase my skills and be used as a portfolio piece. I am still learning but have a solid grasp on C# / HTML / CSS / and PHP. This site is being hosted using Microsoft Azure</p>
